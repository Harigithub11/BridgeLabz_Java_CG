# Object-Oriented Programming

---

## January 6: Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals

- Object creation and initialization
- Instance variables and instance methods
- The relationship between classes and objects

**What I need to do:**
Practice creating more complex classes with multiple attributes and methods.

**Issues faced:**
Understanding the difference between class definitions and object instances required careful study of memory allocation.

---

## January 7: Constructors - Instance vs. Class

**What I've done:**
Studied and implemented:
- Default constructors and parameterized constructors
- Constructor overloading
- Instance variables vs. class (static) variables
- How constructors initialize objects

**What I need to do:**
Master constructor chaining and proper initialization patterns.

**Issues faced:**
Distinguishing between instance and static variables and when each should be used took multiple examples to understand clearly.

---

## January 8: Object-Oriented Programming Practice

**What I've done:**
Practiced implementing OOP principles through exercises combining classes, objects, constructors, and methods.

**What I need to do:**
Continue strengthening object design and proper encapsulation practices.

**Issues faced:**
Designing classes with appropriate responsibility and proper data hiding required careful consideration.

---

## January 9: Keywords - this, static, final

**What I've done:**
Completed exercises on understanding the `this` keyword for object references, `static` keyword for class-level variables and methods, and `final` keyword for constants and method/class restrictions.

**What I need to do:**
Practice applying these keywords in real-world scenarios with inheritance and polymorphism.

**Issues faced:**
Understanding the distinction between instance variables and static variables required careful study of memory allocation concepts.

---

## January 10: Object Modeling and Class Diagram

**What I've done:**
Learned object-oriented design principles, created class diagrams, and understood relationships between classes (association, aggregation, composition).

**What I need to do:**
Apply these modeling concepts to design larger systems with multiple interacting classes.

**Issues faced:**
Visualizing abstract relationships between classes and deciding appropriate class structures took multiple iterations.

---

## January 12: Inheritance

**What I've done:**
Implemented comprehensive inheritance exercises covering:
- **Introduction to Inheritance:** Animal hierarchy, Employee management, Vehicle systems
- **Single Inheritance:** Book-Author relationships, Device-Thermostat systems
- **Multilevel Inheritance:** Order management chains, Course hierarchy structures
- **Hierarchical Inheritance:** Bank account types, School management systems
- **Hybrid Inheritance:** Restaurant management with interfaces, Vehicle systems with Refuelable interface
- **Best Practices:** Method overriding with @Override, proper use of super keyword, constructor chaining

**What I need to do:**
Master advanced inheritance patterns and apply them to complex real-world systems.

**Issues faced:**
Understanding method resolution order in hybrid inheritance required careful study of interface implementation.

---

## January 13: Encapsulation, Interface, and Abstraction

**What I've done:**
Created exercises demonstrating:
- **Encapsulation:** Private fields with public getters/setters, data hiding principles
- **Interfaces:** Contract definitions, multiple interface implementation, default methods
- **Abstraction:** Abstract classes, abstract methods, concrete implementations
- Applied these concepts to practical examples like payment systems, shape hierarchies, and animal behaviors

**What I need to do:**
Practice designing systems that properly balance encapsulation, interfaces, and abstraction for maintainability.

**Issues faced:**
Deciding when to use abstract classes versus interfaces and proper encapsulation levels required thoughtful design decisions.
